            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Paige Gurney, and I grew up in North Logan, Utah. I love to learn new things in all areas of life. However, computer science has always sparked my greatest interest, even as a child. My favorite day of the week in elementary school came when we went to the computer lab. I loved to learn the basics of code. </p>
            <p>As I grew, so did my interest in computer science, so I continued to participate in summer camps, school classes, and pursue coding on my own time. I took robotics classes and won competitions. I explored programming in Python during middle and high school and continue to expand my skills by learning JavaScript and researching AI technology. My passion centers on web development, so I have intentionally focused my classes and camps on that area. I love the challenge of creating a functional and beautiful site. </p>
            <p>Recently, I launched my own business designing and building websites for local companies. All of my clients have loved my work and spoken very highly of my skills in design, development, and communication. </p>
            <p>My love for computer science has expanded to include sharing it with those around me. I love to share my excitement with others, especially girls, to help them find their own way into the STEM field. As a Sterling Scholar, I hope to stand as an inspiration for younger girls to see that they, too, can pursue their dreams of becoming a renowned computer scientist.</p>
