    <div class="essay">
        <p>I began performing ballet with Ballet Aligned in 2022, a local studio in Logan. I have trained at various schools since 2011, but this studio provided me with the wonderful opportunity to serve the community and the Little Lambs Foundation for Kids by performing in our show, The Night Before Christmas. This ballet, created by artistic director Steffanie Casperson, follows the classic story of "A Visit from St. Nicholas" by Clement C. Moore, commonly known as "The Night Before Christmas." The production features dancing mice, reindeer, toys, funny elves, and a delightful Santa Claus. Over my four years with the school, I performed a wide range of roles, including the Rag Doll, Reindeer, Candy Cane, the Shepherdess, and, most recently, the Scottish Doll. </p>
        <p>In total, over the four years, I have helped Ballet Aligned raise more than $11,900 for the Little Lambs. This organization works to “uplift struggling families and foster youth by providing necessary items that no child should have to go without.” Our donations consistently fund the purchase of thousands of essential items that directly support my local community and friends. The most notable purchases this year were two million diapers for families without reliable access to them. By volunteering my time, I helped to turn a community performance into a reliable source of support for families in need. My performances impacted hundreds of people as I shared my love for dance with a community that values the performers, the arts, and supporting their community around them. </p>
        <p>Every year, preparing for the performance requires dedication and perseverance. I invest blood, sweat, and tears into every class, rehearsal, and show. We begin rehearsing for the December show in late August. Many moving parts contribute to a successful production, and I remain deeply grateful for my role as a trusted member of the cast. This year, the directors even entrusted me with teaching and guiding the youngest participants in the cast, known as the Lambs. That responsibility proved deeply gratifying as I helped children as young as three years old learn the basics and experience the thrill of dance. I took great delight in assisting them to put skills together, like skipping and pliés. I celebrated with them as they successfully completed their choreographed dance onstage on December 2 and 3 for a crowd of about 750 people. </p>
        <p>Before that same audience, I successfully performed my role of Scottish Doll for the first and final time. I feel incredibly grateful for the opportunity to perform in such meaningful community service. From the first time I saw it, I dreamed of dancing this role. This performance marked my final year dancing the Night Before Christmas as a student with Ballet Aligned. I take pride in donating my time and talents to the Little Lamb’s cause, a cause that I care deeply about and believe in.</p>
